            <h1>Hi there! My name is Jason and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
            <p>After several months in the Frontend Develoer Career Path, I've developed and deployed several solo projects.</p>
            <h2>How I stay commited to learning</h2>
            <p>I like to thik of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning  and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
            <h2>How I got started</h2>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
            <p>That helped me retain what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
